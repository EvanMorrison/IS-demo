This site provides a gallery sampling my work at [Tazworks](https://www.tazworks.com) on our main product, the Instascreen web app. Instascreen is an application targeted to the background screening industry to help background screeners manage their workflow and grow their business.

I am currently a fullstack software engineer at Tazworks, working in Java on the backend, using mySQL for data persistence, and building the front end in React and Redux. I joined Tazworks in February, 2018, initially as a front-end developer. Since then I have come to lead the front end team and have learned Java to expanded the scope of my abilities to include full stack projects.
